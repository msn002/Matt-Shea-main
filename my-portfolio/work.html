        <h3>‘Our family is suffering’: In Baku, one Azerbaijani journalist still awaits justice</h3>
        <p>BAKU, Azerbaijan – When Gulmira Alsanova visits Prison No. 1 in Nizami District, a municipal district in the capital city of Baku, Azerbaijan, she always makes sure to bring a homemade meal, toys and a copy of her daughter’s homework. With her daughter in school, the weekends have become the most opportune time for Aslanova to see her husband with the entire family.</p>
        
        <p>The typical once-a-weekend meeting provides the family with some normalcy in difficult times. Before her husband, 35-year-old Polad Aslanov, was imprisoned, Aslanova said the family often spent their weekends at the park. But in the years since, their family time has changed.</p>
        
        <p>“While having a meeting with Polad [one weekend], my daughter, since we were meeting with him behind the glass, was beating the glass [for them] to open the glass, [saying] ‘I want to touch my father’ and ‘I want to see my father,’” Aslanova, 32, said in an interview with Capital News Service (CNS).</p>
        
        <p>These visits can be painful, but for the couple’s 10-year-old daughter, Fatima, it is the only way she can spend time with her father.</p>

        </figure>
        
        <p>Beyond being a loved family member, Aslanov previously served as the chief editor and founder of Azerbaijani-focused news sites Xeberman and News.az. His career has taken a pause since his imprisonment, which started with an accusation by the State Security Service (DTX)—the main intelligence and police agency in Azerbaijan—that he was defaming the state, providing foreign countries with sensitive information and putting other Azeri journalists in touch with foreign intelligence agencies, according to news reports at the time.</p>
        
        <p>Aslanov denied all the charges brought against him.</p>
        
        <p>But on Nov. 16, 2020, Aslanov was sentenced to 16 years in prison at the Baku Grave Crimes Court. He was convicted under Article 274: High Treason. According to Fuad Hasanov, a human rights defender working closely on the case, it is considered in Azerbaijan to be the most serious offense. Aslanov is currently serving the third year of his prison sentence.</p>
        
        <h4>EXPOSING THE TRUTH</h4>
        
        <p>Before his imprisonment, Aslanov worked as a reporter covering corruption for his news sites, which he ran with his wife. Small, independent media, such as those run by Aslanov and his wife, are often subject to intimidation in Azerbaijan from local authorities for their reporting on key issues and criticism of the government.</p>

        </figure>
        
        <p>For one story, Aslanov had obtained information that DTX employees were illegally demanding bribes from trip organizers taking pilgrims to Iran and Iraq.</p>
        
        <p>Hasanov said in an interview with CNS that roughly 10,000 people from Azerbaijan and other countries participate in these trips each year.</p>
        
        <p>In order to verify this exploitation, Aslanov bought a national passport and traveled south to the border in October 2017, Aslanova told CNS. There he witnessed individuals stopping buses and demanding money from those leading pilgrimage trips to Mashhad, Iran and Karbala, Iraq. When Aslanov returned, he wrote an article about the events he witnessed and published it on his website in December 2017.</p>
        
        <p>In response, authorities offered Aslanov money in exchange for him to delete the stories, but he refused. Instead, he continued to write about corruption cases, using Facebook to publish content to his roughly 200,000 followers. According to Aslanova, these stories received “high interest from the public.”</p>
        
        <p>“[Aslanov] got some warnings from the Secret Service in Azerbaijan, [who told him] ‘you shouldn’t write about these corruption issues in law enforcement, but especially about Secret Service,’” Hasanov told CNS. “But he didn’t pay that much attention to that warning.”</p>
        
        <p>Aslanov could not avoid the warnings indefinitely. On June 12, 2019, authorities took him and his family into custody while they were attempting to enter Iran for a friend’s wedding.</p>
        
        <h4>ASLANOVA’S ACTIVISM</h4>
        
        <p>“Good morning friends,” Aslanova posted to Facebook the day following her family’s detainment. “Yesterday morning around 10:30 [a.m.] Polad Aslanov, I Gulmira Aslanova and our daughter Fatima Aslanova were detained at Bilasuvar Checkpoint.”</p>
        
        <p>The Bilasuvar Customs Border Point lies directly at a southern border point between Azerbaijan and Iran. In Aslanova’s post, she said that DTX officials brought the family back to a security department in Baku. After being questioned and searched, Aslanova and her daughter were both released, but Aslanov remained in detention for the next four months while investigations ensued.</p>
        
        <p>In the time since, Aslanova has continued to post more content on Facebook regarding the case. She also supported her husband throughout his time in court.</p>
        
        <p>During the trial process, the judge—known in Azerbaijan for making politically based decisions—tried to prevent Aslanov’s lawyer, Elchin Sadygov, and other human rights defenders from monitoring the proceedings. Aslanova referred to this as a “closed” trial process.</p>
        
        <p>“Polad was shouting and making noise during the trial process and urging the judges, the investigator, and others that they please organize the open trial process,” Aslanova said.</p>
        
        <p>Feeling out of options, Aslanov went on a hunger strike. After her husband went on repeated strikes, Aslanova said she was finally able to achieve a meeting with the general prosecutor. It resulted in the reduction of Aslanov’s sentence, but only by three years. Still, Aslanova never stopped advocating.</p>
        
        <p>“I was constantly organizing one-person protest actions in front of the State Security Service Office and also at the same time in front of the prosecutor office with the slogan that ‘you cannot arrest the person, judge the person, with fake trumped-up charges and take a very sweet part of his life [all because of a] politically motivated decision,’” Aslanova told CNS.</p>

        </figure>
        
        <p>But it was this activism that put a target on her back.</p>
        
        <p>“I was receiving different threatening messages targeting myself and my daughter,” Aslanova said.</p>
        
        <p>The threats took a toll on the family. Aslanova told CNS that she had to pull her daughter from school out of fear for her safety.</p>
        
        <p>“Several times I was told [that] my daughter and I will ‘pay a price’ for my being actively involved in this case,” Aslanova said. “I was being threatened by the same people that ‘we will come, and we can punish you.’”</p>

        </figure>
        
        <h4>A STRANGLEHOLD ON THE PRESS</h4>
        
        <p>The struggles that Aslanov and his family have faced are the result of a longstanding system enforced by the government.</p>
        
        <p>Following their separation from the USSR in 1991, Azerbaijan had two leaders overthrown in two straight years. Heydar Aliyev, an Azerbaijani politician from Nakhchivan—an enclave bordered by Armenia, Iran and Turkey—became the country’s third president in Oct. 1993. A decade later, Aliyev’s son, Ilham, succeeded his father and became the nation’s next leader.</p>
        
        <p>The younger Aliyev has been in charge ever since, currently leading a one-party system called the New Azerbaijan Party, which the U.S. State Department has accused of committing a slew of human rights violations.</p>
        
        <p>Nick Lewis, a correspondent for the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), said in an email response to CNS that the country has often jailed journalists on fabricated charges to suppress them, along with using bribery and intimidation tactics.</p>
        
        <p>Those in charge of the Azerbaijani government primarily gain funding through the country’s oil and natural gas reserves. In 1994, the government signed a major oil contract—known as the “Contract of the Century”—involving 13 foreign oil companies from eight nations (including the United States). According to Hasanov, this contract has resulted in around $200 billion in profits.</p>
        
        <p>Lewis refers to this situation as an “Oil Curse.”</p>
        
        <p>“Azerbaijan has significant oil and gas reserves and wealth, but this has both promoted the emergence of elite corruption and authoritarianism, and also granted the government huge resources to put into controlling the media environment,” Lewis told CNS in an email.</p>
        
        <h4>IMPRISONED IN BAKU</h4>
        
        <p>In prison, Aslanov has been denied adequate medical care, according to reports. During earlier visits, Aslanova found her husband with major dental problems and aching pains.</p>
        
        <p>“There are no back teeth on both [of his] palates, they are decayed,” Hasanov told CNS. “[Aslanov] told Gulmira that his back and kidneys hurt.”</p>
        
        <p>In April 2022, problems worsened when Aslanova discovered that her husband had been beaten by another inmate, who, according to Hasanov, “cooperated with the prison.”</p>
        
        <p>“[Aslanov] came from inside the meeting room [and he had] a bruise on the lower side of the eye, so I was surprised and asked him what happened, and he said that ‘nothing [happened]’. But I urged him just to tell me the truth that [his eye] cannot happen by itself,” said Aslanova. “He informed me about the incident that he was beaten and struck by the inmate inside.”</p>
        
        <p>Aslanov applied for a medical examination from the prison, but his request was denied.</p>
        
        <p>Aslanov is imprisoned in Nizami District, a municipal district in Baku, Azerbaijan’s capital.</p>

        </figure>
        
        <h4>WAITING FOR JUSTICE</h4>
        
        <p>After exhausting the matter through Azerbaijani courts, Sadigov appealed the case to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). Lewis said the ECHR is the appeals court of last instance for human rights-related cases when all national appeals have been exhausted. Azerbaijan is one of 46 member states of the Council of Europe under the ECHR’s jurisdiction.</p>
        
        <p>But Sadigov’s appeal lost, and the waiting for Aslanov’s family has continued.</p>
        
        <p>There is a chance for Aslanov to be released from prison, but he must submit a letter to the president confessing his guilt—an amnesty application, according to Hasanov. Those who write this letter may be released if their names appear on an amnesty order.</p>
        
        <p>“Polad was told that if he writes an amnesty application, he can be released with the upcoming amnesty order,” Hasanov said.</p>
        
        <p>While the family has tried to persuade Aslanov to write the letter, Aslanova said her husband is too prideful.</p>
        
        <p>“Polad doesn’t write and doesn’t want to write, and doesn’t agree with their claim to write a letter,” Aslanova said. “And so this attitude perhaps will affect the issue.”</p>
        
        <p>Aslanova said the next order is “expected to take place on March 2024.” The family remains hopeful, but is also prepared for the reality that Aslanov remains in prison. According to Hasanov, there is no guarantee of release as authorities can “deceive” him.</p>
        
        <p>In the meantime, Aslanova is trying to stay in high spirits. She told CNS that she is “getting power from the honesty of Polad.”</p>
        
        <p>“This is the first [thing],” Aslanova said, “And secondly, I am a believer and I believe in God, that the Gods will not leave me alone.”</p>
        
        <p>The Embassy of the Republic of Azerbaijan in the U.S. did not respond to a request for a comment on Aslanov’s case.</p>

        <h3>Opinion: The Hard Truth of Why Harris and the Democrats Lost – and the Way Forward</h3>
        
        <figure>

        </figure>
  
        <p>“While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign–the fight: the fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness, and the dignity of all people.”</p>
        
        <p>Those words were uttered by Vice President Kamala Harris the day after the general election to officially concede the race to President-elect Donald Trump. Standing before an audience on a cloudy day at Howard University, an HBCU in Washington D.C. and Harris’ alma mater, the vice president gave a speech that many in her party did not envision she would ever give.</p>
        
        <p>In the weeks leading up to the Nov. 5 general election, several major media outlets and political pundits had the race neck-and-neck. The edge was often given to Harris, particularly in the “blue wall” states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. There was confidence and excitement surrounding the Harris campaign and among Democrats that a new wave of leadership would be ushered in.</p>
        
        <p>Despite only 107 days on the campaign trail—the shortest general election presidential campaign in our nation’s history—Harris had outraised the Trump campaign “nearly 5-to-1.” Between January 2023 and October 2024, the Harris campaign committee (initially the Biden campaign) raised over $650 million more than the Trump team. In the final two weeks leading up to the election, Harris had raised $19.5 million from big donors, compared to $4.5 million for Trump.</p>
        
        <p>But election night told a different story. Democrats suffered major blows across the country. Trump not only won the electoral college decisively (312–226), but he also managed to capture the popular vote (which he lost by roughly 7 million during the 2020 election), along with all seven swing states. Republicans also managed to maintain their narrow majority in the House, while also flipping the Senate—ensuring a GOP trifecta in the United States government.</p>
        
        <p>This was part of a larger rightward shift seen in states across the country—even in places where Trump lost. In Illinois, for example, a reliably blue state in which Harris won over 54% of the vote, it was the closest White House contest since 2004 (when then-Democratic nominee John Kerry led President George W. Bush by 10 points). Trump also gained in key swing state counties. In Maricopa County, Arizona, Trump gained roughly 56,000 votes. In Wayne County, Michigan, he gained around 24,000.</p>
        
        <p>“The scale of his success was stunning,” wrote Eric Cortellessa for Time. “His campaign outperformed its goal of turning out men and holding women. Trump also increased his share of voters without a college degree, gained ground with Black voters in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and held steady nationally with white women, shocking Democrats who had expected a post-Dobbs uprising.”</p>
        
        <p>Meanwhile, Harris received a drop-off of over 60,000 votes in Maricopa and Wayne from President Joe Biden’s mark in 2020. She also clinched just 59% of the vote in urban areas (typically Democratic strongholds), which was lower than the amount Biden, former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton all received in their campaigns. This was indicative of another major problem at play for the Democrats: voters staying home.</p>
        
        <p>Even considering all of these factors, the election was still relatively tight. The popular vote was a difference of roughly 2–3 million votes, Trump failed to break 51% of the vote in six of the seven swing states (he received 52.2% in Arizona), and he only won each swing state by an average of 108,000 votes (three of the swing states were won by less than 81,000 votes).</p>
        
        <p>“I wouldn’t say [the election] is a Republican victory as much as a Democrat defeat. And the onus really does fall on the Democrats,” said Rick Pearson, the chief political reporter for the Chicago Tribune, who has covered Illinois and national politics for over four decades.</p>
        
        <p>As with any surprising setback, the finger-pointing immediately ensued as Democrats tried to grapple with and explain what had happened. Among the common claims was that Harris had too little time; she was unable to define herself, it was an unorthodox campaign, or, perhaps, the country was not ready for a female president.</p>
        
        <p>While these are all plausible factors that might have contributed to what was seen on election night, the reason that critical voters were turned away from the Democrats can be attributed to far deeper-rooted problems that had long been brewing.</p>
        
        <p>The economy has been a sore subject throughout the tail-end of the Biden administration and is perhaps the largest part of why Democrats failed to connect with voters this election. High inflation and rising daily expenses impacted the lives of all Americans. Consumer prices during Biden’s term rose 20%, significantly higher than the 8% seen during the Trump administration.</p>
        
        <p>“People were just frustrated with the direction of the economy. Even though inflation had dropped from its high, people hadn’t fully felt like their purchasing power had increased,” said Laurel Harbridge–Yong, a professor of political science at Northwestern University and associate director at Northwestern’s Institute for Policy Research. “It’s difficult to buy a home right now. People are financing much of their life on high-interest rate credit cards, and so all of those things contribute to this unease or unhappiness with the state of the economy.”</p>
        
        <p>While inflation has cooled in recent months, it was too little, too late. The negative connotation of the economy weighed heavily in the minds of voters. Ranked as the most important election issue, Gallup found that the economy was likely to be a “significant factor to nine in 10 voters.” A PBS poll found that four in 10 voters considered the economy and jobs “to be the most important problem facing the country.”</p>
        
        <p>“This is an election that in many respects is what we would predict based on people’s perceptions of the economy,” Harbridge–Yong said.</p>
        
        <p>Democrats not only underestimated the severity with which this issue resonated with the American people, but they also failed to foresee the difficulty in overcoming Trump’s advantage in that category. Over a month before the election, reports indicated that Trump was seen as a more positive force in taking on the economy. On election day, Trump still held an edge. The Democrats, as the incumbent party, underestimated the need to paint themselves as a figure of change and provided too little attention to this issue.</p>
        
        <p>“The economy was the most important issue and though we were talking about it, we weren’t talking about it nearly enough to the extent that it was moving voters. That’s where the messaging really fell off,” said Dan Kovatz, the executive director of the Illinois Democratic Chairs’ Association (IDCCA).</p>
        
        <p>Voters not only needed to hear a voice on the economy, but they also needed a plan. Over the course of the campaign, Democrats did not comprehensively explain how they would address concerns over voters’ financial well-being, failing to ease voters’ discomfort.</p>
        
        <p>“The problem is that [Democrats] failed to make a convincing case on the pocketbook issues,” Pearson said. “There didn’t seem to even be a comprehensive economic strategy that was enumerated, even if she had gone after Trump on his call for massive tariffs to be instituted.”</p>
        
        <p>Regardless of how one might view the Trump agenda, it was, at the very least, a solidified plan of attack. Meanwhile, the Democrats did not present a strong argument that they had a plan to fix the economy. Thus, a contrast was created.</p>
        
        <p>Immigration is another significant issue that surrounded this past election. Like the economy, it was an issue that voters held more positive perceptions towards Trump heading into election night. Under the Biden administration, illegal border crossings hit “record levels…averaging 2 million per year from 2021 to 2023,” according to The Washington Post.</p>
        
        <p>A lack of security at the border impacted many Americans. From a rise in fentanyl deaths to the harrowing story of Laken Riley, these issues affected real people and underscored concerns that Democrats had neglected.</p>
        
        <p>“It was reflective of difficult policies, maybe bad judgments, and a huge wave of really unprecedented, unfettered immigration,” said Jay Reyes, an Illinois Republican Party state central committeeman. “Here in Chicago, we tend to see that more often. You couldn’t drive by a police station without seeing tent cities or old schools and empty buildings get filled with temporary housing for people.”</p>
        
        <p>This issue pulled voters from typically Democratic demographics away from the party. According to Time, “exit polls suggest that as many as 45% of Latinos voted for Donald Trump – up from 32% during the 2020 presidential election, and signaling a major rightward shift among the fastest-growing ethnic group in the U.S.”</p>
        
        <p>“There’s a substantial number of Latinos here in the United States who look at what states have done with the broken border, and they did everything right to become citizens, and [illegal immigrants] come in and they’re taking the resources away,” Pearson said. “I do think in the minds of some of these voters it carries some resonance.”</p>
        
        <p>According to Harbridge–Yong, there is a larger issue at play that has created a disconnect between the Democratic Party and their typical voting groups. “There was initially a function among the Democratic Party and Democratic activists that their party would naturally benefit given the previous voting patterns of minority groups,” she said. “But we have seen that as the Democrats have maybe not reached out and tried to listen to the specific concerns of particular subgroups of minority voters, [minorities] have been more open to campaigning from the [Republicans].”</p>
        
        <p>The Democrats’ mistake was not just the failure to recognize and understand these problems, but also the naive expectation that voters would still side with them simply because of Trump, or due to negative perceptions about the Republican party. Voters care about who has a plan, and by ignoring these issues and failing to listen to the needs of voters, Democrats made a crucial misstep.</p>
        
        <p>“Minority voters are starting to wake up to issues, rather than the ‘dog-whistle’ approach that Democrats have tended to implement against them,” Reyes said. “As a minority myself, I hear and see a lot of messaging that says ‘Sure, Republicans are this or that, but they’re racist.’ [Minorities] are not really buying it anymore.”</p>
        
        <p>The migration of some voters to the Republican party was not enough to win the elections in 2024. Democrats who stayed home also played a crucial role and showcased the growing divide within a party in desperate need of soul searching.</p>
        
        <p>According to Pearson, there is a “significant schism” developing among the progressive and moderate factions of the Democratic party. Division over social, cultural, and foreign issues has stretched the party thin and drawn voters away.</p>
        
        <p>“Part of the drop-off in Democrats was also the feeling that the Democratic party has shifted too far left, and that the comfortable middle in voter’s views doesn’t exist anymore,” Pearson said. “If you’re out on the extremes, that’s not where the vast majority of people are and that doesn’t get you elected to anything.”</p>
        
        <p>According to Kovatz, more Democrats “ended up staying home” in this year’s election. Many voters also flocked to third-party candidates. With a lack of solidarity within the base, Democrats were in a bad position against a Republican party that was unified around Trump.</p>
        
        <p>Democrats will need to work in the coming years to come together and define their objectives for helping the American people. But until then, the groundwork for the 2028 election will start in 2026.</p>
        
        <p>Looking towards the midterm elections, the House will be up for grabs along with 33 Senate seats (20 held by Republicans, 13 by Democrats). For Democrats, flipping one of the two chambers is a realistic and worthy objective. In particular, the House may present the best chance. In the 23 midterm elections from 1934 to 2022, the president’s party has only gained seats in the House three times and eight times in the Senate.</p>
        
        <p>“Given history, it's traditionally the out of power party that picks up House seats. The fact that it is still a very narrow majority for Republicans, Democrats have a great opportunity [to flip the chamber],” Pearson said. “Part of that is to see how the initial years of the new Trump presidency unfold. If the economy is going great, the Democrats are going to have to find a way to say they can make it better in a demonstrable way, rather than just saying ‘trust me.’”</p>
        
        <p>As for the Senate, Democrats’ ability to flip the chamber will be determined by how many seats the parties must defend that are competitive. In this year’s Senate race, Democrats “both had a number of seats that were up for election, but also a number of ones in states that Trump had won or come close to winning in 2020,” according to Harbridge–Yong. This made it difficult for Democrats to hold onto their narrow Senate majority in 2024. If the Trump term starts rocky, Republicans could find themselves in a similar situation in 2026.</p>
        
        <p>Unfortunately for Democrats, the president’s party has picked up Senate seats in the last two midterms (one under Trump, one under Biden). Reyes is confident that solving key issues will keep this trend alive for the GOP.</p>
        
        <p>“We’ve entered sort of a peculiar political time where a lot of the old truisms about politics don’t necessarily apply anymore,” Reyes said. “People want a strong economy. They want to get a handle on inflation. They want to address a lot of the crime that's still concerning them. If [Republicans at the national level] are able to focus on those things and prioritize those things that are important to voters, rather than personal interests, I think you'll see the majority continue.”</p>
        
        <p>For Democrats, Pearson said a way to start regaining support is by focusing on the split-ticket voters who contributed to swing state losses. These are voters who chose Democratic candidates and initiatives for state and local elections, but still voted for Trump in the national election.</p>
        
        <p>“Look at some of these down ballot races that Democrats won despite the fact that Trump won that state’s presidency. Lessons can be learned from North Carolina, where all statewide offices went Democratic and Trump won,” Pearson said. “Part of it is maybe the fact that these elections have become too nationalized, and [the Democrats] need to refocus their message on local issues.”</p>
        
        <p>Final Commentary: Voters were looking for an answer and an ease to the stress of the last couple of years. Amidst the chaos, voters wanted the direction that offered hope and change to the biggest issues facing the nation.</p>
        
        <p>Democrats lost because they failed to calculate that many Americans vote based on policies, not people. The electorate moves toward the side they feel will change these issues for the better—even if it means electing someone they don’t think is a good person all the time—no matter how much false fear is stoked about the candidate or his supporters.</p>
        
        <p>The American people will simply not be bullied into who they can or can’t vote for. They will not be told what vote makes them a good person or citizen, and they certainly will not let someone else tell them what is in their best interest. Trying to shame or shun those who vote differently based on differing needs or opinions is, in itself, quite undemocratic. And, frankly, it is un-American.</p>
        
        <p>The shift that played out in this election started months before Harris entered the race, when some Americans felt left in the dark about Biden. They saw a party that had covered up the health and whereabouts of a sitting U.S. president and then appeared to aggressively oust that same president mid-election to deny primary voters their choice—abandoning American principles all to win an election. It made the argument that Republicans are the only threat to democracy or the only party that doesn’t follow the rules seem hypocritical and ill-founded. Democrats failed to recognize the lack of trust that was forming due to the mishandling of these serious and viable concerns, and they denied to hear out those who questioned the administration.</p>
        
        <p>Many Americans are smart enough to know that Trump isn’t necessarily a good person, just as they are smart enough to know that supporting his policies over Democratic ones doesn’t inherently equal Nazism, racism, or sexism (flagrantly fallacious and deceitful comparisons that show a lack of understanding of the sensitivity of those words). Many Americans saw through the false equivalencies and offensive generalizations levied against those who dared to disagree with Democratic policies or thinking, and they stood up—not for Trump, not out of hate towards Harris, but for policy, their own principle, and to not be told who to vote for.</p>
        
        <p>If a Trump administration with full congressional power can provide relief to these key issues, Democrats may have more time on their hands to rebuild. Republicans are better served utilizing this opportunity to build bridges and tackle the issues on the minds of the American people. Squandering this moment could put Democrats back in the White House soon. To be fully prepared, the Democratic Party must first take a look in the mirror.</p>

        <h3>Upcoming 2025 Report: The Impact of the Holocaust on Viennese Jews</h3>
    
        <p>As part of my ongoing research, I am currently working on a long-form investigative report examining the lasting impact of the Holocaust on Vienna’s Jewish community. This project will explore how the Nazis decimated Austria's Jewish population, it will dive into the segregation, discrimination and harrasshment that Viennese Jews faced from the Nazis and ordinary civilian collaborators, and it will examine the role that Austrian society plays in acknowledging and addressing its past. My work will include interviews with historians, profesors, and community members.</p>

        <h4>Visualizing the Jewish Presence in Vienna Over Time</h4>
    
        <p>For this report, I include two key visuals. Figure 1.a showcases where Austrian Jews emigrated to from 1938 - 1941 as they sought to escape Nazi persecution. Figure 1.b shows information behind the deportation of Austrian Jews to ghettos and extermination camps during large-scale efforts in 1941 and 1942. </p>
