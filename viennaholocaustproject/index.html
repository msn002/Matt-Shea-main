            <h2>A City Set Ablaze, A Community Erased</h2>

            <p>VIENNA – The streets of Vienna burned with a fury of hatred on the night of November 9, 1938. The air was
                thick with smoke as flames consumed synagogues, Jewish-owned businesses lay in ruin, and shattered glass
                blanketed the streets—so much so that the night became infamously known as Kristallnacht, the Night of
                Broken Glass</p>

            <p>Across the Nazi-occupied German Reich, the night marked an unprecedented escalation of antisemitic
                violence. Roughly 7,500 Jewish businesses were looted and destroyed, 1,406 synagogues were set on fire,
                and at least 1,300 to 1,500 Jews were murdered. Jewish homes were invaded, their residents brutalized
                and arrested, while Nazi officials ordered police and firefighters to stand down.</p>

            <p>Vienna was no exception. The city’s Jewish community—once a thriving part of its culture and intellectual
                life—became a primary target. In a single night, 93 synagogues were burned to the ground, and around
                6,000 Jews were deported to the Dachau concentration camp. But amid the devastation, one synagogue in
                the city survived—the Stadttempel, Vienna’s City Temple.</p>

            <p>Built between 1825 and 1826, the City Temple was the only synagogue permitted within Vienna’s inner city.
                Its survival was not an act of mercy, but a matter of practicality. Regulations had required it be
                architecturally integrated with surrounding buildings, and destroying it would have risked damaging
                non-Jewish properties. A synagogue that had long served as the religious and cultural epicenter of
                Vienna’s Jewish community became the sole survivor and figure in the community’s revival post-Holocaust.

                longest-surviving synagogue in the city of Vienna – the only in the city to survive Kristallnacht. The
                temple has long served as a religious and cultural hub for Vienna’s Jewish community. (Photo by Matthew
                Shea)</p>

            <p>Before Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany, Vienna was home to 167,249 Jews – large enough to fill
                Madison Square Garden eight times over. When the Nazis surrendered in 1945, the Jewish population of
                Vienna had been reduced to half of one MSG arena.</p>

            <p>Today, the Stadttempel remains the only pre-war synagogue in Vienna still in use. Far more than just a
                house of worship, it stands as a remnant of a nearly erased community – a link to Vienna’s Jewish past
                and the heartbeat of its present.</p>

            <p>I was able to experience this history firsthand. On a guided tour of the Stadttempel, I walked through
                its restored sanctuary, where the weight of its past was palpable. Through these tours, the temple keeps
                the memory of the Holocaust and Vienna’s Jewish history alive. My guide, Vit Lichtenstein, shared the
                stories of those who worshipped here before World War II and those who returned after it—fragments of a
                once-thriving community.</p>

            <p>To understand what this temple represents, one must go back to the beginning—the moment Austria welcomed
                the Nazis with open arms and set the stage for the near-total destruction of its Jewish community.</p>

            <h2>How did the Nazi annexation change life instantaneously for Vienna’s Jewish population?</h2>
            <blockquote>“The entry of Hitler’s army into Austria in March 1938 triggered unprecedented suffering and
                hardship for Vienna’s Jews. Grave acts of violence against the Jewish population began to proliferate.”
                – The City of Vienna</blockquote>

            <p>In March of 1938, Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg found himself – and his country’s independence –
                under intense domestic and international pressure. At home, many Austrians, influenced by the events
                transpiring in Nazi Germany, were becoming openly supportive of the Nazi regime and a potential takeover
                of their country. At the same time, Schuschnigg was receiving demands and threats from Nazi dictator
                Adolf Hitler. Most recently had been a request asking Schuschnigg to appoint an Austrian Nazi Party
                leader as the country’s Minister of the Interior and Security.</p>

            <p>Losing a grip on the nation, Schuschnigg made a final stand. On March 9, 1938, he announced a referendum
                to affirm Austria’s status as an independent nation and propel an impending Nazi annexation. But any
                hope for an Austria free of Nazi rule was soon lost. Two days later, the chancellor received an
                ultimatum from the Reich Chancellery in Berlin. An outraged Hitler had sent a demand: Schuschnigg was to
                postpone the referendum or face the wrath of the Nazi armed forces, otherwise known as the Wehrmacht.
            </p>

            <p>Hours later, a second ultimatum was received. This time, Hitler demanded that the Austrian chancellor
                step down. Facing immense pressure, Schuschnigg cancelled the referendum and resigned. That night, to
                the warm greetings of many, Nazi forces crossed into Austria as they took power. The Nazis did not bring
                hatred with them into the city – it was already rampant.
                “Antisemites would say things before 1938 like, ‘Vienna is so horrible because the city is Jewish. So
                the antisemitic association linked Vienna to Jewish presence, and then said it was bad,” said</p>

            <p>Frances Tanzer, a Professor of Holocaust Studies and Modern Jewish History and Culture at Clark
                University. “And these are obviously stereotypes, this is not reality.”</p>

            <p>Before the annexation, Viennese Jews had experienced antisemitic abuse from ordinary civilians. The
                arrival of Hitler in Austria worsened an already dark situation for Vienna’s Jewish community.</p>

            <p>On March 13, 1938, with the support of 99.7% of the Austrian public, the Law on the Reunification of
                Austria with the German Reich, also known as the ‘Anschluss law’, officially made Austria part of Nazi
                Germany. Jews had been barred from the vote. Two days later, Hitler stood from the balcony of Neue
                Hofburg Palace in Vienna’s Heldenplatz as he delivered his annexation speech to hundreds of thousands of
                cheering Austrians.</p>

            <p>“Austrian Nazis very much participated in the process of taking over of the state. So it was not really
                an invasion,” said Michaela Raggam-Blesch, who has served as a research fellow at the Department of
                Contemporary History at the University of Vienna since 2018. “In fact, before the first German soldier
                crossed the border, Austrian National Socialists had already taken over most institutions.”</p>

            <p>For Jews in Vienna, life was disrupted in a way not yet seen in other parts of the Third Reich. Nazi
                control not only reinforced Jew-hatred – it legalized it. Businesses identified to have Jewish ownership
                were looted, graffitied with a Star of David, and boycotted. People of all ages gathered around and
                watched as Jews in Vienna were forced to scrub slogans in support of Austrian independence off the
                streets.</p>

            <blockquote class="testimony">Survivor Testimony: “We lived in the 2nd district, on Krummbaumgasse. It was
                the center of religious Jewry…People were driven out of their flats and forced to scrub the streets with
                buckets and brooms and scrubbing brushes…The onlookers jeered, and not only that, they kicked them and
                poured buckets of water over people. But it wasn’t just water…”<br><span class="source">– Documentation

            <p>On March 18, 1938, Nazi officials raided the Vienna Jewish Community offices and arrested their
                leadership. This was the beginning of a slippery slope for Vienna’s Jewish community.</p>

            <p>Following the ‘Anschluss,’ the Nazis gradually implemented legislation that segregated the Jewish
                community and restricted them of their rights.</p>

            <p>“The level of terror against the Jewish population after the “Anschluss” was unknown in Germany,”
                Raggam-Blesch said. “There, anti-Jewish legislation was introduced over the course of five years, while
                in Austria, it was implemented overnight.”</p>

            <p>The basis of Nazi discrimination was the idea that Germans were members of a superior ‘Aryan’ race, while
                Jews, according to the Nazis, belonged to an inferior race and required separation. This radical
                ideology took legislative form in the Nuremberg Race Laws and other policies that ostracized Jews from
                society and stripped them of their most basic human rights.</p>

            <img src="timelinepic4.jpeg" alt="Timeline graphic" />

            <p>“The Nuremberg Race Laws…were pivotal in the Nazi regime’s systematic persecution of Jews,” Lichtenstein
                said. “The implementation of these laws led to the social ostracization of Jews, barring them from
                various professions, educational institutions and public life.”</p>

            <p>The level of antisemitism and intimidation reached a tipping point during Kristallnacht on Nov. 9–10,
                1938. Despite being attacked internally that night, the surviving Stadttempel proceeded to become a
                crucial location for the Nazis during the war. The City Temple held all the records and archives of the
                Jewish community of Vienna, making it “a focal point for Gestapo” in their persecution efforts,
                according to Lichtenstein. Following Kristallnacht, Nazi policies became more severe.</p>

            <p>“In Vienna, the violence [from Kristallnacht] was particularly severe,” Lichtenstein said. “This
                orchestrated violence shattered any remaining illusions of security for Austrian Jews, leading to a
                surge in emigration and marking a prelude to the Holocaust.”</p>

            <p>As Jews in Vienna started to fear for their safety, many sought refuge in other countries to escape the
                antisemitic violence and bigotry faced under Nazi rule. From 1938 to 1941, over 120,000 Austrian Jews
                fled Vienna. 17,000 would later be caught by the Nazi regime. Most of the exiles never returned to
                Austria, according to Lichtenstein.</p>

            <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/21756709"></div>

            <p>As Vienna’s Jewish population dwindled due to emigration, those who remained soon faced a grim fate. The
                Nazis turned their efforts towards the systematic removal of Jews from the city. What began as forced
                displacement shifted to a machine of deportation.</p>

            <h2>How did Vienna’s deportations become a model for the German Reich and speed up the reduction of the
                Jewish population?</h2>

            <blockquote>“Once individuals defined as Jewish arrived in collection camps, they already stopped being a
                human being… They became a number,” – Dr. Raggam-Blesch</blockquote>

            <p>It was the night of Oct. 2, 1940, and Hitler was hosting a private dinner in his Berlin apartment. One
                guest was Baldur von Schirach, an Austrian politician who shared Hitler’s vision and was feeding off
                antisemitic enthusiasm from the populus. That night, Schirach came with a cruel vision for Vienna.</p>

            <p>“Baldur von Schirach was a very ambitious politician. In the fall of 1940, during a private dinner with
                Adolf Hitler, he expressed his desire to ‘get rid’ of the Jewish population in Vienna,” Raggam-Blesch
                said.</p>

            <p>At this point, Vienna was still the only city across the Third Reich to host a deportation – the
                transport of 1,600 Jews a year earlier. Schirach’s plan sought to expand the usage of Vienna as a
                testing ground for the German Reich and make it the first city ‘free of Jews.’</p>

            <p>Hitler sat on this proposal for nearly two months. On Dec. 3, 1940, Hitler revealed to Schirach his
                decision to deport the remaining Jews in Vienna and place the blame on “housing shortages.”</p>

            <p>“The party chancellery sent a written statement to Baldur von Schirach stating that the Führer had
                granted ‘the early deportation’ of the Viennese Jewish population,” Raggam-Blesch said. “It thereby
                referred to 60,000 persons, which was roughly the number of the remaining Jewish population in Vienna at
                that time.”</p>

            <p>At the beginning of 1941, Vienna’s Jewish community was impoverished and concentrated in the 2nd District
                of Leopoldstadt. By that time, Vienna housed Austria’s entire Jewish population. Jews were not allowed
                to leave the city, according to Raggam-Blesch.</p>

            <p> “When we talk about the Jewish population of Vienna, one must understand that at that time this was
                essentially the Jewish population of Austria, which had been expelled from other regions of the country
                during the years following the ‘Anschluss,’” Raggam-Blesch said.</p>

            <p>The deportation of Vienna’s Jewish community was led by the Central Office for Jewish Emigration.
                Established three years prior by Adolf Eichmann, a German-Austrian official and elite guard of the Nazi
                regime, the Central Office sought to expel the Jewish population at a greater pace. It was the only
                authority of its kind anywhere in the Third Reich.</p>

            <blockquote class="testimony">“In Vienna, therefore, for the first time anywhere in the Reich, they set
                about creating a Central Office for Jewish Emigration, whose sole task is to deal with the emigration of
                the Jewish parasites,”<br><span class="source">– An excerpt from an antisemitic article in “Völkischer
                    Beobachter (Vienna edition”), May 14, 1939</span></blockquote>

            <p>In 1941, the Central Office was led by successor Alois Brunner, who held the rank of captain of the elite
                guard of the Nazi regime. Brunner went on to organize the forced deportation of over 45,000 Jews to
                ghettos and extermination camps.</p>

            <p>The process started in February, with the establishment of assembly points at Jewish schools in Vienna.
                These “collection camps” were based in the 2nd district and served as a waiting point for Jews while
                their fate was decided.</p>

            <p>“People got a notification, a postcard, informing them that they were summoned on a specific date with a
                specific amount of luggage to one of the collection camps set up throughout Vienna,” Raggam-Blesch said.
                “They were given a short amount of time to prepare everything. Sometimes it was two weeks, sometimes
                just a week, and sometimes only a few days. People were expected to give up all [their] belongings…”</p>

            <p>Those that ignored a report to appear at a collection camp were arrested and handed over to the police.
            </p>


            <blockquote class="testimony">Survivor Testimony: “Over the last few weeks we’ve had very many troubles.
                Everyone was constantly whispering something about ‘Jews must go to Poland,’ but of course we all
                thought that was a rumor…And unfortunately the news was true. Over the next few days you trembled when
                the postman rang, because anyone could receive the summons – the death sentence!<br><span
                    class="source">– The Leo Baeck Institute – New York | Berlin</span></blockquote>

            <p>Nazi authorities showed up at collection camps and conducted a process known as “commissioning,” in which
                Jews were either deported, released or deferred. Those chosen to be deported were taken from the
                collection camp to Vienna’s Aspang Station.</p>

            <p>On February 15, 19, 26 and March 12, five transports, each carrying 1,000 people, left Aspang Station for
                Opole, Lubelskie, Kielce, Modliborzyce and Łagów/Opatów ghettos. With the start of these smaller-scale
                deportations, Vienna cemented its status as a model to be used across the German Reich. Over the next 20
                months, Vienna’s Aspang Station hosted over 45 transports that deported Jews to ghettos and
                extermination camps.</p>

            <p>In June 1941, the Nazis decided to alter their policy from deportation to extermination. The ‘final
                solution,’ the Nazis’ aim to murder the entire Jewish population, was in full effect. Before the
                implementation of the ‘final solution,’ 80% of those murdered in the Holocaust were still alive,
                according to the Illinois Holocaust Museum & Education Center. To further target the Jewish community,
                the Nazis mandated in September 1941 that all those defined as Jewish under the law wear a yellow star.
                In October 1941, the Nazis imposed a ban on “friendly contact” between Aryans and Jews.</p>


            <blockquote class="testimony">“Then came the terrible star…one was really truly outcast. And that role was
                very difficult for a rather obstreperous 12/13-year-old to play…suddenly a woman came and gave me a slap

            <p>On Oct. 15, 1941, the Reich-wide deportation of Jews to ghettos and murder sites began. Jews in Vienna
                were transported from all four collection camps to Aspang Station and from there to potential death. The
                first transport carried 1,000 Jews to Litzmannstadt/Łódź ghetto.</p>

            <p>The Jewish community was aware that deportation could lead to death. Many committed suicide in order to
                evade the summons, according to Raggam-Blesch. In November 1941, when some in the Jewish community
                started refusing to appear for deportation, the Central Office began to “extract” Jews from their homes.
            </p>

            <p>“Brunner was known for his ‘innovations’ which earned him the title of a ‘deportation expert.’ In Vienna,
                he introduced a new system, where people would not be informed about their imminent deportation,”
                Raggam-Blesch said. “Instead, the Central Office for Jewish Emigration would organize systematic raids
                in the middle of the night or during the early morning hours. The SS would come to people’s homes while
                they were sleeping. They arrested them in their apartments and took them directly to the assembly
                camps.”</p>

            <p>On Oct. 9, 1942, the final transport left Aspang, carrying 1,323 Austrian Jews to Theresienstadt
                extermination site. Of those deported, only 2,100 survived. In March 1943, the Central Office was
                disbanded. From then onwards, the deportation of Jews in Vienna continued from the North Station. There,
                another 33 transports went on to deport around 1,760 more people.</p>

            <p>When Vienna was liberated by the Soviet Red Army on April 13, 1945, around 5,500 Jews had survived in the
                city. As Nazi rule came to a close on May 8, 1945, 65,000 Austrian Jews had been murdered in the
                Holocaust. Jewish leaders and survivors began re-establishing the community that month, but the road to
                recovery was long and difficult.</p>

            <h2>What factors hindered the rebuilding of Vienna’s Jewish community?</h2>


            <blockquote>“The transformation of Jewish Vienna – from a community assumed to be dissolving in 1945 to a
                growing, diverse, and active population today – illustrates the resilience of Jewish culture and the
                evolving nature of migration, memory, and identity in the post-Holocaust Europe,” – Vit Lichtenstein.
            </blockquote>

            <p>After the war, the vast majority of Vienna’s Jewish population was gone as a result of the Holocaust. For
                those in the Jewish community that had survived or returned, antisemitism was still persistent. Jewish
                citizens who had been expelled were not welcomed back and faced “quite some hostility” upon their
                return, according to Raggam-Blesch. Following the war, Austrian society was not ready – or did not want
                – to discuss what was done to the Jewish population.</p>

            <p>“[Austrians] have to confront missing colleagues, missing audience members…and at the same time, there’s
                also an intense desire in the postwar period to not talk about the Holocaust, and to not talk about the
                fact that Jews and non-Jews had previously co-constituted cultural life,” Tanzer said.</p>

            <p>After the Holocaust, many assumed that Jewish life in Vienna would not continue. Much of the remaining
                Jewish infrastructure and assets were transferred to Israel, “reinforcing the perception that Vienna’s
                Jewish presence was being dismantled rather than rebuilt,” according to Lichtenstein. As the only place
                of worship in Vienna to survive, the Stadttempel became a place for remaining Viennese Jews to determine
                next steps.</p>

            <p> “The Stadttempel… functioned primarily as a transitional center – a place where displaced and returning
                Jews could reconnect with their roots, search for missing relatives and process emigration to Israel,
                the United States, or other countries,” Lichtenstein said.</p>

            <p>At the same time, there was significant efforts from Austrian society to separate themselves from the
                Nazi Party. This was spearheaded by the Victim Theory. Despite Austrian society overwhelmingly
                supporting the ‘Anschluss,’ this theory instead asserted that Austria was actually the first “victim” of
                the Third Reich.</p>

            <p>“[The Victim Theory] reaffirms this idea of Austrian victimization, and in the postwar period it’s really
                touted as a way to create distance between Austria and National Socialism, distance between Austria and
                Germany and to instead link Austria to a Western European context,” Tanzer said.</p>

            <p>This twisting of the narrative is just one part of Austria’s “immediate post-war tendency to eradicate
                the past,” according to Raggam-Blesch. Following the war, both Aspang and North deportation stations
                were destroyed, along with the site of the Central Office. Images of Austria’s non-Jewish population
                celebrating the Nazis were “not publicized.”</p>

            <p>“[Recognition of what happened] takes really a long time, and it’s in part due to this victim myth…which
                is also a desire to erase complicity in the Holocaust of the Nazi period,” Tanzer said.

            <p>It was not until the 1970s that things began to shift. Over time, the Jewish community began to gradually
                reconstitute itself. While the number of Jews who returned to Vienna remained relatively low, there was
                an influx in Soviet Jewish immigration, including those from the USSR, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan.</p>

            <p>“Despite initial expectations, Jewish life in Vienna did not disappear,” Lichtenstein said. “Soviet Jews,
                many of whom had lived under state-sponsored atheism, reintroduced cultural and religious diversity to
                Jewish life in Vienna.”</p>

            <p>Furthermore, the candidacy of Kurt Waldheim, who ran for Austria’s presidency in 1986, also changed the
                conversation. During the campaign, Waldheim had attempted to deceive the public about his involvement in
                the Nazi armed forces. However, when this information was uncovered it did not impact his candidacy, and
                Waldheim went on to win the election. This affair was followed by significant international condemnation
                and proceeded to strain relations between Austria and the United States and Israel.</p>

            <blockquote class="testimony">“The exposure of Waldheim’s Nazi-era past also precipitated a long-overdue
                reckoning, in Austria and beyond, with the truth about the country’s own mid-century past. The Waldheim
                controversy led directly to a belated, and in many quarters anguished, confrontation with the myth,
                cherished in Austria for more than four decades, that the country had been ‘Hitler’s first victim,’
                when, in fact, it was actually his homeland and enthusiastic ally, a nation whose citizens had played a
                disproportionate role in perpetrating the Holocaust and other Nazi-era atrocities.”<br><span
                    class="source">– Eli Rosenbaum for World Jewish Congress</span></blockquote>

            <p>It also forced Austrian civilians to reckon with their Nazi past, paving the way for a long-overdue
                dialogue within Austrian society. In 1991, Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky started this shift
                through his recognition of Austria’s complicity in the wartime atrocities. Vranitzky took it a step
                further, proceeding to give a historic speech in Jerusalem just two years later.</p>

            <p>In 1995, the National Fund of the Republic of Austria for Victims of National Socialism was established
                to provide the Austrian-Jewish victims of Nazi rule with compensation. Today the National Fund supports
                various research and restitution projects, and also managed the finances for the construction of the
                Shoah Wall of Names Memorial, which opened in November 2021. The memorial commemorates the
                Austrian-Jewish victims of the Holocaust.</p>

            <p>In stride with Austrian cultural changes, the 1990s also saw another increase in the Jewish population of
                Vienna. Immigration from Eastern and Western Europe, Israel, and the U.S. contributed to “a more diverse
                community,” according to Lichtenstein.</p>

            <p>“These successive waves of immigration revitalized the community and led to the founding of new Jewish
                institutions, schools, and cultural centers,” Lichtenstein said. The result was the transformation of
                the Stadttempel “from a site of post-war transition into the heart of a re-established Jewish
                community.”</p>

            <p>Due to this tumultuous history, conversations on the impact of the Holocaust are still ongoing in
                Austria. In recent years, efforts have been made by government officials to restore long-awaited justice
                to the Austrian-Jewish community. In 2019, the Austrian parliament unanimously adopted an amendment to
                the Austrian Citizenship Act that has since expanded citizenship access “towards persons persecuted by
                National Socialism and their descendants.” Austrian parliament also unanimously passed the
                Austrian-Jewish Cultural Heritage Act in 2021 to fund the protection of Jewish institutions.</p>

            <p>These measures represent steps towards acknowledging Austria’s past; however, it cannot undo the
                devastation that reshaped Vienna’s Jewish community. While efforts to preserve Jewish heritage continue,
                the scars, and an ongoing battle, remain.</p>

            <h2>The Stadttempel Stands: A Symbol of Resilience and Modern Struggle</h2>

            <p>While Jewish life has continued in Vienna, the community has never fully recovered. Standing today at
                around 10,000 to 12,000 people – a shadow of its pre-war presence – this number is a reminder that the
                damage of the Holocaust reverberates to this day.</p>

            <p>Today, the Stadttempel remains the heart of Vienna’s Jewish community. Serving as the central synagogue
                for Ashkenazi Orthodox Jews, the temple continues to operate as a religious center with doors opened
                every Shabbat evening.</p>

            <img src="staddpic8.jpeg" alt="Stadttempel entrance" />
            <p class="caption">The front entrance of the Stadttempel sits tucked in the middle of a tight alleyway in
                Judenplatz. The temple doors are opened every Shabbat. (Photo by Matthew Shea)</p>

            <p>“[The City Temple] serves as a major institution for Jewish identity in Austria,” Lichtenstein said. “The
                synagogue stands as a testament to the unexpected revival of Jewish life in Vienna, despite its
                near-total destruction during the Holocaust.”</p>

            <p>As the Jewish community seeks to regain its footing in Vienna, the state of antisemitism and Holocaust
                denial threatens Jewish communities across the globe once again.</p>

            <p>“An estimated 2.2 billion people – 46% of the world’s adult population – harbor antisemitic attitudes,”
                according to the Anti-Defamation League. Around the world and online, many continue to distort the
                Holocaust, compare Jews to their Nazi perpetrators or claim that these atrocities are a myth.</p>

            <p>While the Stadttempel stands as a symbol of survival, it also serves as a reminder of the dangers that
                arise when the dehumanization of Jews is normalized. The story of Vienna’s Jewish community shows that
                we must speak up and take a moral stance against what is wrong – even when the masses won’t.</p>

            <h2>About the Project</h2>

            <img src="matthewsheashoah.jpeg" alt="Shoah names wall detail" />



            <p>My name is Matthew Shea, and I am a political writer and reporter from the Washinton D.C. area. In
                February 2025, I spent a week reporting from Vienna, Austria to cover this story. I had the opportunity
                to visit the Stadttempel, Neue Hofburg Palace, The Monument to the Victims of the Holocaust and the
                Shoah Wall of Names Memorial.</p>

            <p>I also spoke to key experts and stakeholders in order to ensure historical accuracy and add the realness
                of survivor testimonies. This project took months to complete and required extensive research, the usage
                of Flourish visuals, and the crafting of this webpage through VS Code and Github.</p>

            <p>This is a story that is deeply important to me and very relevant in today's world. Antisemitism,
                Holocaust inversion and denail are all on the rise. At the same time, we are close to losing those who
                can provide first hand accounts of these atrocities. The world is projected to lose 90% of Holocaust
                survivors within 15 years, acording to 2025 Claims Conference Data. We have a duty to remember and honor
                these stories to ensure that this can never again happen to any Jewish community anywhere. </p>
